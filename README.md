# HabitFlow

HabitFlow is a simple and mindful habit tracking app built with SwiftUI. Its goal is to help users build consistent habits without the pressure of "everyday streaks."

## What is this app for?

Most habit trackers focus on daily streaks and often "punish" missed days. HabitFlow takes a different approach — it values regularity and consistency over perfection. It's a gentle, visual system to support sustainable habit-building.

## What's implemented

- Add new habits
- See a list of today's habits
- Mark habits as done / not done
- Habits are stored persistently using `UserDefaults`
- Initial UI design using SwiftUI

## What’s planned

- History view with previous completions
- Weekly and total progress visualization
- Dot-based chart for visual consistency tracking
- Migrating data storage to **Realm** (planned)

## Tech stack

- Swift (compatible with Swift 5+)
- SwiftUI
- MVVM architecture
- `UserDefaults` for lightweight local storage (temporary solution)
